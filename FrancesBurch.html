<h2>
Overview
</h2>
	<p>I was born in NYC and spent my early childhood in Port Washington, but grew up in Nashville, TN. I received my Bachelor of Arts from Wells College in Aurora, NY, in 1993. The following year, I moved to NYC. Shortly afterward, I met my husband. We have lived in downtown Manhattan ever since.</p>

<h2>
Professional Background and Education
</h2>
	<p>I have worked primarily as a web developer in agency environments in the NYC metro area. My industry experience includes real estate, music publishing, non-profit, finance, and health care. I completed the first training program in Microsoft .NET technology offered at Baruch College CAPS in the early '00s, along with a 3 month immersive at SetFocus in Parsippany, NJ immediately following.</p>

<h2>
Things that I am interested in learning
</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A test driven approach to developing. My experience tells me that this would improve both my quality of life on the job and the end result.</li>
		<li>More about an Agile approach to working. I have not worked in an Agile environment, but I have read some books and taken a workshop at GA.
		</li>
		<li>Git. I have worked with many source control products in the past, and Git appears to offer a significant improvement. I especially like the fact it has a large body of community support and documentation. Also, it is fairly easy for anyone to set up their own sandbox to start learning and playing without the hassle of licenses, etc.</li>
		<li>Better Javascript. Traditionally, it is not my favorite technology, but I think that improving my skill level and familiariaty with some of the cool new libraries out there these days might change that.</li>
		<li>Updated html/css. When I first learned html, an older standard was in place, the tags were still typically in all caps, and mobile devices were not a concern.</li>
		<li>Improved comfort level in a different development environment. Until recently, I had not touched a Mac in about 2 decades. I look forward to becoming as facile and comfortable with a OS X as I am with Windows.</li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails. I think it will make a nice addition to and a welcome change of pace from my existing experience, which includes ASP.NET, C#, VB.NET, VB Script, and Visual Basic.</li>
	</ul>

		<li>Science/tech podcasts on NPR and the new "Cosmos" television series</li>
		<li>Playing poker and other games with friends</li>
		<li>The soroban abacus</li>
		<li>Italian and French language. From time to time, I will watch a film or read an article in one or the other, even though I am not as conversational as I once was.</li>

<h2>
Guilty Pleasures
</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Reading in bed late at night. It can be anything - genre fiction, classics, books about the brain, the WSJ. This has been a problem since I was very small.</li>
		<li>vulture.com</li>
		<li>An obsession with Mad Men. Yes, I have put together an outfit that took inspiration from an early episode for a '60s themed party.</li>
		<li>Addiction to Game of Thrones, both the show and the books. George R. R. Martin is definitely to blame for some of my procrastination.</li>

About this website
</h2>
Some minor glitches and issues that I faced while working on this site:
	<ul>
		<li>Some weirdness installing Sublime on Mavericks. I had installed and it once before, and it disappeared from both my dock and Finder. I couldn't get it to run from Terminal either. Eventually, I uninstalled it, and found <a href="https://tutsplus.com/lesson/installation-and-base-settings/">this helpful tutorial</a>  before reinstalling. SFSG.</li>
		<li>My initial choice for hosting a link to my picture, Dropbox, did not give me a user friendly image link that appeared correctly in the browser. I added it to my Photobucket account instead, where I had better luck obtaining a link that I could use.</li>
	</ul>
